# C - malloc, free

This project demonstrates dynamic memory allocation in C using malloc and free.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- Proper usage of malloc and free functions
- Memory leak prevention and debugging with valgrind

## Files Description
- **0-create_array.c** - Creates an array of chars and initializes it
- **1-strdup.c** - Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space containing a copy of a string
- **2-str_concat.c** - Concatenates two strings
- **3-alloc_grid.c** - Returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers
- **4-free_grid.c** - Frees a 2D grid previously created by alloc_grid
- **100-argstostr.c** - Concatenates all arguments of the program
- **101-strtow.c** - Splits a string into words

## Compilation
All files are compiled with:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
```
